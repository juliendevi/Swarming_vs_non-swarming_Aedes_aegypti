# Head transcriptome differencies between swarming and non-swarming mosquitoes (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>)
Whole head RNA-sequencing of swarming and non-swarming yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) males analysis.  


## Differential gene expression analysis

The code 'Gene_lvl_analysis.R' contain the analysis of RNA-seq at the gene level with differentially express module analysis. 

## Differential transcript expression analysis

The code 'Trancript_lvl_analysis.R' contain the analysis of RNA-seq at the trancript level. 

## Single nuclei RNA-seq analysis

The code 'snRNA_seq_10X.R' contain the re-analysis of single nuclei RNA-seq data for brains of both sexes in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> from Cui et al., 2022 (Accession numbers documented in the script).
